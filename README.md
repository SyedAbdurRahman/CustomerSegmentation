# CustomerSegmentation

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we implement a machine learning model to perform a specific predictive task. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## **Dataset**

## **Technologies Used**

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
